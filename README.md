# Day 6 – Modular Signup Form with Context and Validation

This project is part of my 150-day developer preparation journey focused on building scalable and production-ready React applications. On Day 6, I engineered a modular, responsive signup form using reusable components, centralized state, and advanced validation techniques.

## ✅ What I Practiced:
- Reusable `InputField` component accepting label, type, id, and placeholder props
- `FormWrapper` component to manage submission logic and layout
- Context API to centralize `formData`, `errors`, and handlers
- Validation using `onChange` and `onBlur` for real-time feedback
- Regex-based validation for email and password strength
- Cross-field validation for confirm password
- Tailwind CSS layout with responsive design

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:
- Component architecture: separating smart and dumb components
- Props vs Context: form inputs access state without drilling
- Regex and state-driven error rendering
- Modular logic that scales across forms like login, signup, profile edit

## 🛠 Features:
- Dynamic input rendering via props
- Validation messages per field
- Context-driven state management for clean architecture
- Styled UI with Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first design responsiveness

## ⚙️ Tech Stack:
- React.js with functional components
- Context API
- Tailwind CSS
- Regex for form validation

## 🔥 Why This Matters:
In real-world apps, forms carry trust and interaction. Today’s structure prevents prop clutter, simplifies validation, and enables clean reuse across multiple flows. It's the kind of clarity top product teams demand.

> Day 6 complete. Each modular form brings me closer to engineering excellence and product-level thinking. Ready for Day 7. Let's build.
